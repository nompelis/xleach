 Xleach - v0.1

 Ioannis Nompelis <nompelis@nobelware.com>

This is a little utility in the making to "leach" the X11 root-window from a
given X server and display it in an X11 window that is mapped in another X
server.

It is far from optimized --on purpose-- and it barely functions at present.
It does have Unix user-permissions prerequisites to execute properly, although
it can be used maliciously with superuser privileges.

The reason it is (temporarily) uploaded to Github is for possibly showing it at
a Minneapolis "Hardcore Hacknight" meet-up:
